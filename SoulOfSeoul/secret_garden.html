				<h1 class="h1_enter">Secret garden, plot</h1>
				<hr class="hr_enter">
				<p>Kim Joo-Won (Hyun-Bin) is from a wealthy family, smart and good looking. He runs the luxurious Roel Department store, which his family owns. Oska (Yoon Sang-Hyun) is a popular singer around Asia, but he doesn't have musical talent. He is also a womanizer. Joo-Won and Oska are also cousins and highly competitive towards each other.</p>
				<p>On a request by Oska, Joo-Won goes to pick up actress Park Chae-Rin from a shooting set. Joo-Won mistakes stunt woman Gil Ra-Im (Ha Ji-Won) for Park Chae-Rin and takes stunt woman Ra-Im to a hotel. Oska made the request in an attempt to prevent Park Chae-Rin from revealing their relationship to the press. At the hotel, Joo-Won discovers that the woman he picked is not actress Park Chae-Rim but a stunt woman. During this time, Joo-Won starts to experience strong feelings for the feisty stunt woman, even though she isn't his type. Joo-Won tried getting Ra-Im out of his mind for Ra-Im does not own a high status life nor is even rich. Nevertheless, Joo-Won can't stop thinking about Ra-Im.</p>
				<p>Later, Joo-Won sneaks into an action school to watch Ra-Im. Meanwhile, Ra-Im tries her best to ignore Joo-Won because she knows Joo-Wan belongs to another higher social level compared to her. Nevertheless, Ra-Im can't help her blooming feelings towards Joo-Won.</p>
				<p>Yeun-Sul (Kim Sa-Rang) and Oska are ex-lovers, but they can't seem to forget each other. Because Yeun-Sul had a high-living status, she was arranged to attend a blind date with Joo-Won. Even though Joo-Wan made it clear that he doesn't have interest in her, Yeun-Sul keeps pursuing Joo-Won. Yeun-Sul knows Joo-Wan is Oska's cousin and wants to use him to get under Oska's skin. Yeun-Sul then manages to become the director for Oska's next music video, which is scheduled to be shot on Jeju Island.</p>
				<p>Meanwhile, stunt woman Ra-Im is a fan of Oska's music and wins a contest to go to Jeju Island with Oska himself. Ra-Im also wanted to take part in Oska's music video. Joo-Won learns that Ra-Im won the contest to spend time with Oska and decides to follow them to Jeju Island.</p>
				<p>On Jeju Island, the main participants all gather. While they were mountain biking, Ra-Im gets separated from Joo-Won and Oska. Joo-Won searched frantically to find Ra-Im. Eventually, Joo-Won was able to find Ra-Im but ended up stranded in a mysterious restaurant in the middle of the woods called 'Secret Garden'. Even more mysteriously, the owner of 'Secret Garden' seems to know both Joo-Won and Ra-Lim very well. The owner presented two bottles of homemade floral wine to Joo-Won and Ra-Im. They manage to find their way back to the hotel before night and went their separate ways. At night, neither Joo-Won nor Ra-Im find themselves able to sleep and each takes this time to clear their mind while drinking their individual gifted wine. A twist of intrigue takes place in the plot when both Ra-Im and Joo-Won wake up in the morning to find that their souls have switched to the other's body!</p>
