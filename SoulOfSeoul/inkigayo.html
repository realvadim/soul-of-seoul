				<p><span class="numberring">KPOP Music Shows: How to Apply for Tickets</span><br />As Korean K-pop continues to spread worldwide, there have been an increasing number of inquiries on how to take part in TV music programs produced by major broadcasting companies in Korea.</p>
				<p>Music programs are incredibly popular since audience members can see a number of their favorite singers perform all in one place. One big bonus is that, unlike concerts, tickets are free to those who apply online and are picked in the lucky draw. Let’s take a look at how you too can apply for tickets from each broadcasting company and attend some of your favorite TV music shows!</p>
				<p><span class="numberring">SBS Live K-POP Countdown (Ingigayo)<br /> 1.</span> To apply to be part of the studio audience of the Ingigayo program broadcast live on SBS you must first sign up on the official site of SBS (Seoul Broadcasting Station). You will need your alien registration card (issued in Korea) and your alien registration number. It is best if you can speak some Korean or if you can receive help with translation of the procedure and results.<br /><a href="https://sbscert.sbs.co.kr/login/member/join/agree.jsp" target="_blank">>> Go to Member Sign-up Page</a></p>
				<p><span class="numberring">2.</span> Once you connect to the SBS Ingigayo website (http://tv.sbs.co.kr/gayo/), you will need to click on the “Studio Audience Application” (방청신청), the fourth menu item down on the left-side of the main page.</p>
