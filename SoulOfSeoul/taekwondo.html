				<p><span class="numberring">Taekwondo Tours</span><br />Taekwondo is Korea’s most representative martial arts and is a globally-recognized sport. Not just an important defensive art that has played a key part in Korean history, Taekwondo also improves the physical abilities and mental strength of its practitioners.</p>
				<p>Want to learn more about this exciting skill? Highly-trained masters (many with experience in both Taekwondo and Hapkido) welcome international visitors of all ages and experience levels to join in the fun for an unforgettable Taekwondo Experience!</p>
				<p>If your time is limited and you’re a Taekwondo beginner, you may want to try the ‘Namsangol Hanok Village Taekwondo Experience Program’ (1 hr) or the ‘1-Day Taekwondo Culture Tour’ (choose between a 90-min or a 3-hr Taekwondo class). For a deeper look into the world of Taekwondo, check out the ‘Taekwondo Training Programs,’ which can be taken anywhere from 2 to 15 days and can accommodate Taekwondo students of all levels.</p>
				<p>For anyone unable (or not quite ready) to jump in and learn Taekwondo, there is also a Taekwondo performance titled ‘Legend of Taekwondo,’ an amusing story that sets the backdrop for a stunning display of skill by Taekwondo masters.</p>
