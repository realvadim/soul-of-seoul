Karaoke is called Norebang (노래방) in Korea. Norebang means sing room. You can find the 노래방 sign everywhere in Korea especially in entertainment districts or student areas.</p>
				<p>Many Korean’s start off their night at bars and restaurants and end up in Norebang by the end. It is here that they can have some more fun with friends and sing their favourite songs. Also Norebangs are a great place to sober up after a few drinks or hang out until the morning if you missed your last train.</p>
				<p>There are many different themes and styles to Norebangs in Korea. In most Norebangs, each room has a different them such as a Korean style room, French style, Bar style and so on. Usually Norebangs serve beer, soft drinks and snacks. The prices are generally cheap but there are some top range expensive Norebangs around. Usually the room is rented out by the hour but some Norebangs rent out the rooms per person. An average price is about 15,000 won an hour.</p>
				<p>Most Karaoke rooms come equipped with 2 microphones, a tamborin, a remote control for selecting songs and a song book. There is quite a collection of English songs, Japanese songs and sometimes Chinese songs.</p>
