		<hr class="hr_enter">
		<p>Lee-Sul (Kim Tae-Hee) is a woman who enters college later than other girls. Like her peers, they dream of one day becoming a princess, but for Lee-Sul she actually becomes a real life princess...</p>
		<p>Hae-Young (Song Seung-Heon) is a 31-year-old diplomat. He is the sole successor of the Daehan Jonghap Group (the largest conglomerate in Korea). Hae-Young is also handsome and graduated from an Ivy League school. Agreeing to his grandfather`s creed, Park Hae-Young decides to give up his rights to the company and all of his assets. This is all for a young woman named Lee-Sul.</p>
		<p>Lee-Sul is a 25-year-old college student, majoring in Art History. She doesn't think about the secrets surrounding her birth or her stepsister who teased her behind her back. Lee-Sul keeps a shabby appearance and works several part time jobs on top of her college career. She also has a crush on her professor Nam Jung-Woo (Ryu Su-Yeong). One day, Lee-Sul becomes a princess overnight. In order to make her a princess, the President of the Daehan Jonghap Group offers all of his assets. 50,000,000 people stamp their approvals for her and royal families from all over the world sends congratulatory telegrams. Lee-Sul accepts the role of Princess, but she is now locked up in her palace and forced to study from dawn to late at night. Even worse, Park Hae-Young is her only instructor and he is snooty.</p>
		<p>Yoon-Joo (Park Ye-Jin) is a 30-year-old woman, who works as the director of Hae-Young Museum. Her father is the secretary for the President of the Daehan Jong Group. Yoon-Joo hopes to marry Park Hae-Young one day to gain control over the company. Her plans come to a halt when the Princess suddenly appears. For the Princess, the President of the Daehan Jonghap Group returns all of his property to the community. Even Hae-Youngs begins to have favorable feelings for Lee-Sul. Yoon-Joo can't forgive Lee-Sul for what she has caused. Yoon-Jo then makes a plan and if it succeeds Korea will lose their imperial family.</p>
		<p>Jung-Woo (Ryu Su-Yeong) is a professor, archeologist and holds a PH.D in the Arts. He is also popular among the female students. Jung-Woo grew up in a poor family. Even now with his high status, his financial situation isn't so good. Because of this, Jung-Woo hasn't proposed to his girlfriend Yoon-Joo. One day, something strange happens. Jung-Woo's student Lee-Sul (who always submits papers late, but works hard at excavation sites) turns out to be a princess. Lee-Sul then asks Jung-Woo to become an advisor for the "Redemption Committee of Imperial Family Cultural Assets".</p>
