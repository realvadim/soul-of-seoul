		<p>Asian countries have been doing exchanges through culture and trade throughout history. Trends spread throughout the region at an incredibly fast rate. The 80's were a time for “Hong Kong Noir” while the 90's were more an age of Japanese animation. The 2000s have seen a sharp rise in the popularity of Korean culture, with music and dramas hitting all the right notes. Interest in Korea, triggered by the success of leading Korean dramas and popular music, continues to escalated to include a host of other aspects of Korean culture, such as hangeul (Korean alphabet), hansik (Korean food), hanbok (traditional Korean clothing), hanok (traditional Korean houses), hanji (traditional Korean paper), as well as Korean music. In Korea, the aforementioned six cultural symbols are collectively referred to as “Han Style”.</p>
