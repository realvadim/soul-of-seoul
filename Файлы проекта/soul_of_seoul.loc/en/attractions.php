		<p>The Gyeongbokgung Palace, built in 1395, and is home to the National Folk Museum of Korea, a great Seoul attraction. The Namsangol Hanok Village is also a good stop, featuring traditional Korean homes from the Joseon Dynasty. The Bongeunsa, a Buddhist temple founded in 794 AD, offers a 'Temple Stay Program' for visitors.</p>
		<p>Just out of town, visitors can ride the Namsan Park cable car to the summit of the mountain to see the maritime aquarium and botanical gardens. Lotte World is the largest indoor theme park in the world, one of the most exciting Seoul attractions, while the 1988 Olympic Park and Stadium is another. There are lovely antique shops and art galleries to be browsed in the Insa-dong alleyways.</p>
